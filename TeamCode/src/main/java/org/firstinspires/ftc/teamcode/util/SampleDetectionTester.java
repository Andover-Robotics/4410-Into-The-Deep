/*
 * This OpMode illustrates how to use a video source (camera) to locate specifically colored regions
 *
 * Unlike a "color sensor" which determines the color of an object in the field of view, this "color locator"
 * will search the Region Of Interest (ROI) in a camera image, and find any "blobs" of color that match the requested color range.
 * These blobs can be further filtered and sorted to find the one most likely to be the item the user is looking for.
 *
 * To perform this function, a VisionPortal runs a ColorBlobLocatorProcessor process.
 *   The ColorBlobLocatorProcessor process is created first, and then the VisionPortal is built to use this process.
 *   The ColorBlobLocatorProcessor analyses the ROI and locates pixels that match the ColorRange to form a "mask".
 *   The matching pixels are then collected into contiguous "blobs" of pixels.  The outer boundaries of these blobs are called its "contour".
 *   For each blob, the process then creates the smallest possible rectangle "boxFit" that will fully encase the contour.
 *   The user can then call getBlobs() to retrieve the list of Blobs, where each Blob contains the contour and the boxFit data.
 *   Note: The default sort order for Blobs is ContourArea, in descending order, so the biggest contours are listed first.
 *
 * To aid the user, a colored boxFit rectangle is drawn on the camera preview to show the location of each Blob
 * The original Blob contour can also be added to the preview.  This is helpful when configuring the ColorBlobLocatorProcessor parameters.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
